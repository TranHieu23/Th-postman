Analysis and Observations
Fetching Book Details

This request is expected to retrieve information about multiple books. To make it functional, additional details such as the endpoint URL and query parameters should be included.
Currently, it lacks specifics on how the data is fetched and what responses are expected.
Fetching Single Book Details

Similar to the "Fetching Book Details" request, this request aims to get information for a single book but is incomplete without the endpoint URL and other necessary details.
Login

The login request is well-defined with a specified method, headers, and body.
The use of a local file path (C:/Users/ADMIN/Downloads/phomai.mp4) indicates the need for a local file for the request, which might need to be adjusted for different environments.
The presence of a hardcoded token (TOKEN) in the headers should be handled carefully, especially in production environments.
Recommendations
URL and Parameters: Ensure that the endpoints for "Fetching Book Details" and "Fetching Single Book Details" include the complete URL and any necessary parameters.
Authentication Security: Avoid hardcoding authentication tokens directly in the collection. Consider using environment variables for security tokens.
File Paths: Make file paths dynamic or provide guidance on how to set the correct path for different environments.
Response Definitions: Define expected responses for each request to facilitate testing and validation.
